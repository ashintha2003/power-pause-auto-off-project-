# Power Pause â€“ Auto-Off Device

This was my first-year, first-semester project. The **Power Pause** device is designed to automatically turn off electrical appliances (such as electric irons or hair straighteners) when they are not in use for a specified period of time. 

What makes this project unique is that it was developed **entirely using analog circuitry**, without the use of any microcontrollers. The circuit detects whether the appliance is actively being used. If it remains idle for too long, the device powers it off automatically to ensure safety and energy efficiency.

The time duration before shutdown is **user-configurable** and is displayed using **two seven-segment displays**.

- **Schematic Design**: Multisim
